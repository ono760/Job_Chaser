# Job Chaser

***

This full-stack, CRUD application was developed in a team-setting environment with the goal to provide the public with a reliable place to research potential job opportunities and to keep track of their outcomes. 

Users can search for jobs via Indeed.com's API, keep a personal list of jobs they're interested in, and save information related to these jobs (notes, application stage, interview questions). Job Chaser also allows job-seekers to share interview questions, job postings, and provide general tips to other users based on their own experiences.
